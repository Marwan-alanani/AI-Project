# AI-Project: Sports Activity Detection

This project focuses on detecting sports activities using deep learning techniques.
It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to classify various sports activities from input data.

## 🧠 Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately identify different sports activities. 
The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled examples of various sports, enabling it to learn distinguishing features and make accurate predictions.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `main.py`: The main script to load the trained model and perform predictions on new data.
- `Sports_Detection.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the data preprocessing, model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.
- `model.h5`: The saved Keras model file containing the trained weights.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Marwan-alanani/AI-Project.git
   cd AI-Project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Running Predictions:**
   The `main.py` script can be used to load the trained model and perform predictions on new input data. Ensure that your input data is preprocessed in the same manner as the training data.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *Note: Modify `main.py` to specify the path to your input data and handle the input/output as per your requirements.*

2. **Understanding the Model:**
   The `Sports_Detection.ipynb` notebook provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the data preprocessing steps, model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.
